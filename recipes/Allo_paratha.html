        </li><br>

                <li>Mix well until all the spices are evenly incorporated into the potato mixture.</li>
            </ul></li><br>
        <li>Shape the parathas:
            <ul><br>
                <li>Divide the dough into equal-sized portions and roll them into balls.</li>
                <li>Take one dough ball and flatten it with your hands.</li>
                <li>Dust it with flour and roll it out into a small circle.</li>

            </ul>
        </li><br>
